# 🎟️ CryptoEventPass - QR-based Ticket Validation

## 📖 Project Description
**CryptoEventPass** is a blockchain-powered ticketing system designed for secure event access using **QR code validation**.  
Each event ticket is issued as a unique, tamper-proof record on the blockchain and validated by matching encrypted QR hashes.
